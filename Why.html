              When  can you visit Kenya?
            </h5>
            <p>
              Kenya lies on the equator and consequently has a very pleasant tropical climate with the average temperature between 20°C (68°F) and 28°C (82°F) during the day.
               The weather is warmer and wetter by the coast, while the lowlands is hotter and drier. The highlands are always colder. Actually, Kenya is a country, which is worth visiting
                throughout the year.

              About the delicacies of foods and Kenyan drinks.
            </h5>
            <p>
              Kenya can boast excellence of many dishes. The main ingredients are superb quality meat, tropical fruit, vegetables and a local freshwater fish.                              Kenya’s                                            cuisine is also famous for rice and seafood curriers with coconut milk, tamarind or spicy aromas.

              The most popular dish for breakfast is Uji (a thin porridge) or some kind of bread – usually a tape of flat bread (a chapatti of Indian origin).                                                                                                     Sometimes mahamri is served with coconut milk (a heavier fried bread). You can also try kumaras and yams, which are potatoes.

              Let’s find out more about specialities!

             Ugali is a stiff, cornmeal porridge, usually eaten with a meaty stew (supu), various kinds of spinach and beans. Nyama choma is a roast meat served with  a spicy tomato                                     relish. Sukuma Wiki is made from spinach and tomatoes, sometimes includes meat, potatoes and other ingredients. Irio is a mixture of green peas, potatoes,                                                             kernels of corn and meat or only with Sukuma Wiki. Kachumbari is a potato and onion relish served with meat. Mandazi is a puffy  sweet or savoury, deep-fried                                                      doughnut. Tilapia is a popular freshwater   fish. Biryani and Pilau are  mixed rice dishes, made with  spices, meat or       vegetables.

You can taste a lot more of delicious dishes, but we want to introduce you  the last dish, which is Maharagwe – kidney beans in   coconut                                soup.

          Most known beverages are chai (tea with milk and sugar) and kahawa (coffee). You can also enjoy good beer. Tusker, Pilsner, Safari and White  Cap are the  main local brands.                         You can also try Uki, which is a traditional beer made with honey. Wine is popular, too. Naivasha is a place with  a small viniculture         industry.
          Changaa is a spirit made from maize and sugar. Dawa Cocktail is a mix of vodka, white rum, honey and lime juice. Kenya Cane is white rum and Kenya  Gold is coffee liqueur.
