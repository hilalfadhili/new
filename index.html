                      <p>üí•The
                        Current world has been reduced to a global village due to the advanced technology in communication, health, security, education, business etc.
                         With this, there has been a considerate improvement in literacy and skills advancement in the population which has catalyzed the human co-existence.</p>

                         <p>üí•As the world is on toes and dynamically moving forward, most grassroots villages in the suburb of Africa are yet to experience these advancements. In the most part of Kenya- Africa, most women and youths are languishing in poverty and desperation despite having attained O-level certificates with promising grades.
                           This is a great threat to economic freedom, security and informative decision making in the current affairs.</p>

                           <p>üí•The major contributing factor to this is the fact that they have no skills.  The Kenyan government has been on the fore front advocating for hundred percent transition from primary
                             schoolto secondary school. This was or is a well thought move unless a question is poised, ‚ÄúWhat next after form four?‚Äù Truth be told! There has been a failed system to
                             ensure there is a considerate transition of learners from high school to colleges and universities where they will be trained on skills.</p>
